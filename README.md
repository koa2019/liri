Mastering Markdown Instructions: 
https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

1. Problem the app is trying to solve (i.e. what is it doing and why):
    This app is using NodeJs,a server side software, to request selective data from API libraries & console.log the returned responses.

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized
    First, the app imports the node packages and files required to make request calls to the intended API & are saved to variables for an easier way of refernecing them throughout the code. 

    Secondly, the app checks if enough arguements were passed through the CLI

    Then, the app captures the third & fourth arguements from CLI and saves them to a variable

    

3. Give start-to-finish instructions on how to run the app
    *must provide your own .env file with your own Spotify secret creditentials

4. Include screenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
